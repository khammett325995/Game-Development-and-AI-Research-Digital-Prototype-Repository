# Game-Development-and-AI-Research-Digital-Prototype-Repository
This is a repository to act as part of a simulation for the research's digital prototype.

Note: For the mobile game digital prototype, it is in a desktop Figma model due to the limitations of the development software but simulates what would be intended of a game on a mobile device.

Desktop Game Digital Prototype: https://www.figma.com/proto/8hVoXqukSQveWEcztOsCiY/Game-Design-and-AI-Research-Digital-Prototype--PC-Model-?node-id=2-2&p=f&t=iKEBFSSjpZikufrF-1&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=0%3A1
